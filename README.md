DEADLOCK DETECTION ALGORITHM 
AIM:
To Simulate Algorithm for Deadlock detection
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the Program
Step 2: Get the values of resources and processes. 
Step 3: Get the avail value..
Step 4: After allocation find the need value. 
Step 5: Check whether its possible to allocate.
Step 6: If it is possible then the system is in safe state. 
Step 7: Stop the execution
